This is my submission for cs50 game development assignment 2: Breakout

This "remastered" version of the 1976 classic Atari Breakout includes Powerups such as multiball and locked bricks requiring a key to unlock. The best part, however, in this new version is 100% the banger music that is highly addictive.
